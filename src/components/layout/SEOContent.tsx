      <p>
        PomoZen is a simple, aesthetic <strong>Pomodoro timer</strong> designed to help you study and work more effectively. 
        Unlike other <strong>online timers</strong>, PomoZen runs entirely in your browser, meaning it works 
        <strong> offline</strong> and respects your privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are using the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> for studying, coding, or writing, our 
        built-in <strong>white noise</strong> and nature sounds (Zen Mode) help block out distractions.
        Track your <strong>focus sessions</strong> without needing to create an account.
